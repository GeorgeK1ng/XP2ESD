A solution to build modern Windows XP / 2003 in both architectures in any language.

Builded images can be deployed from bootable USB to many HW configurations. See MDL topic for more details. 
Most modern HW tested is Z790!

For installation on modern HW you need to have CSM. UEFI is not supported
